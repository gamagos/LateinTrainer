These are rules I want the AI to follow when generating code

# Good (single content with quotes)
("content")
["content"]

#Good (content in [] and {})
[thing]
{other thing}

# Good (multiple contents or no quotes)
( content1 )
( content1, content2 )

#Good (lists with multiple strings in them)
["abc", "abc"]

#Good (multiple quote contents or content and quote content)
( "content", "content" )
( "content", content )

# Good (single symbol or strings)
(1)
[5]
["only for strings"]

#Good (= signs)
variable = something #allways leave space between the items and the =
widget.config( parameter = thing )

#Good (space between methods and classes) #dont do this for methods in methods
class c1:
    def method():
        code
        code
        return


    def method2():  #leave 2 spaces between methods for readability
        ...


class c2: #leave 2 spaces between classes for readability
    def ...

# Bad (multiple quote contents)
("content1", "content2")  # Don't use quote style with multiple items

# Bad (single digit in brackets)
[ 1 ]  # Don't use space style with single symbol
