These are rules I want the AI to follow when generating code

# Good (single content with quotes)
("content")
["content"]

# Good (multiple contents or no quotes)
( content1 )
( content1, content2 )
[ 1, 2, 3 ]

# Good (single digit)
(1)
[5]

#Good (= signs)
variable = something #allways leave space between the items and the =

# Bad (multiple quote contents)
("content1", "content2")  # Don't use quote style with multiple items

# Bad (single digit in brackets)
[ 1 ]  # Don't use space style with single digit
