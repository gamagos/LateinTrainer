# Description

This is a Latin Grammer Forms Trainer I made to learn the declensions, conjugations
and other grammer hassles the Latin language holds.
It's primary purpose is for you to study the grammar tables e.g noun-declensions,
verb-conjugations etc by heart with features to make you learn faster than
going through them in a school book.
As this software is more of a hobby project
I can't guarantee that it works very well ( even though I'm trying )
so please report bugs to me on the issues page on github
so I can make this program suck less.
